# Review of week1

What programming structures (or concepts) did you learn at http://code.org last week?

After discussion, the class concluded:

1. Code a sequence of instructions to achieve a goal.
2. "Repeat" loop to repeat instructions a set number of times.
3. "While" loop to repate instructions while a test condition is true, e.g.
    ```
    while( pathAhead() )
        moveForward
        [do something]
    ```
4. Define a function for a block of code that you can invoke from someplace else in your code. A function lets you "modularize" code and reuse code without repeating the instructions.
5. "if" statement for *conditional logic*, so some instructions are executed only if a condition is true (or false).
    ```
    if( pathAhead() )
       moveForward
    else
       turn(left)
   ```
