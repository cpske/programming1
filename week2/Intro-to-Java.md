### Introduction to Java

1. Why Java?

    [2017 Programming Language Ranking on IEEE Spectrum](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/top-programming-languages-2017-focus-on-jobs) ranks Python slightly above C and Java overall (Python 100.0, Java 99.4), but Java is #1 for Jobs.  IEEE uses data from 10 different sources.  You can create a custom ranking (change weights).

    [Coding Dojo](http://www.codingdojo.com/blog/9-most-in-demand-programming-languages-of-2017/) Programming Jobs: SQL was most in-demand. Java was #2 (about 68K job postings), Python moved up 2 spots to #3 (40K postings), slightly ahead of Javascript.

2. About the language.

    Java is a *compiled*, *statically typed* programming language designed for object-oriented programming.  All code is contained in classes.  Java is very portable -- compiled code can run on any computer with a JVM installed. See below for code example.

3. How Java works.

    Java is designed so that the compiled code (called "Java byte code")
can be run on any machine that supports Java.  The same byte code
runs the same on Mac OS, Windows, Linux, or anything with the Java
Runtime installed.

    This is different from languages such as C or C#, 
where the code must be recompiled for each target platform.
