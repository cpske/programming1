## Git and Github Assignment

1. **Install git** on your computer.
    * Windows and MacOS: download from [https://git-scm.com/downloads][git-scm]
    * Ubuntu: run `sudo apt-get install git`
    * Other Linux: see instructions at [https://git-scm.com/download/linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)
2. **Run** these **git** commands in a command prompt window (*aka* a terminal or shell) to verify git is working on your computer:
```
cmd>  git --version
git version 2.14.x (your version may be different) 
cmd>  git help config
(prints a help message for how to use "git config")
```
3. Before you can use Git with Github or Bitbucket you must tell git **who you are**. This info is including in commit messages.  
Enter these commands (just one time) on your local computer:
```
cmd>  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
cmd>  git config --global user.email "youremail@ku.th"
cmd>  git config --list
(shows the config values)
```
You can change this info anytime by running `git config` again.

5. Create an account on [Github](https://github.com), and complete the following in your profile:
    * Your **full name in English**, with proper case of letters, e.g. Bill Gates.
    * A **photograph** *clearly* showing your *face*.
    * Your **KU-Gmail** address.
    * (Optional) Write a **profile** about yourself.
    * Example last year OOP students: [Jirayu](https://github.com/JirayuL) and [Kongpon](https://github.com/kykungz) (they both got "A" in OOP2)
    * Employers look at your Github account, so do a good job! Its part of your **resume**. For example: [https://kykungz.github.io](https://kykungz.github.io)
