### Please install the JDK and JDK docs in a path without spaces

> To avoid path problems and for convenience adding new versions of the JDK, you should install Java in a **short path without spaces**.
>
> Good: `c:\java\jdk8u144` (Windows), `/opt/java/jdk8u144` (Linux).    
> Bad: `c:\Program Files\Java Development Kit\jdk_1.8.0u144`

## Programming Tools You Need

> BlueJ (IDE) for Windows and Mac OSX includes the Java JDK. If you install BlueJ you can skip #1.

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): [JDK 8 Downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/.
2. Integrated Development Env (IDE) for writing code. Please try BlueJ, but you can use whatever IDE you prefer.
    * [BlueJ](https://www.bluej.org) - great for learning. You can interactively run code without compiling, view objects, and visualize project structure.
    * [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/downloads) - powerful, but complex.
    * [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/downloads) - similar to Eclipse but easier to get started. Install the "Java SE" version.
    * [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - many say this is most powerful Java IDE. Somewhat hard to master.  The "professional" edition has a free [Student License](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/).  There is also a "Community Edition" that is free for everyone.
3. [JDK Documentation](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/jdk8-doc-downloads-2133158.html). Please install on your computer and **bookmark** the API docs in your browser (demo in class).
    * You can view the [JDK Documentation online](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/) at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/, but its much faster to install on your computer and bookmark it.
    * The [Java API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api) is what you need most. Bookmark it!
    * [Download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/jdk8-doc-downloads-2133158.html).  You don't need the JavaFX docs.
    * The IDE (Eclipse, BlueJ, Netbeans) can show context sensitive help using the API docs on your computer. Eclipse can also get Javadoc from source code.
4. [Git command tool](http://git-scm.org/download/) from http://git-scm.org/download/ (not needed at beginning). The "git" command line program is needed to submit some assignments. IDEs have builtin Git support, but command line is sometimes better.

## Recommended

Oracle's [Java Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)
is *very* comprehensive, from beginner to advanced topics.  The [Really Big Index](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reallybigindex.html) page is the best way to find specific material, so bookmark it.  

We suggest you [download the tutorial](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/java-tutorial-downloads-2005894.html) and install it on your computer.  You can download the tutorial as HTML or ebooks (ePub).

## Online Coding Sites

Good places to practice Java coding, with immediate feedback:

* [elab](http://elab.cpe.ku.ac.th) for lab work in this course.
* [codingbat.com](http://codingbat.com/java) - many short problems, with explanation and solutions. Enter code into browser window and see test results immediately.
* [stepik.org](https://stepik.org) has a nice "[Adaptive Java](https://stepik.org/2403)" course created by JetBrains.  It chooses problems based on your past answers, so problems get progressively harder.  You can write code in browser or upload a file.

## UML Diagrams

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is the standard for visual diagrams that describe software -- like circuit diagrams for software.
In Programming 2 (OOP) you will use UML a lot.  
The most useful diagrams are **class diagram** and **sequence diagram**, which are easy to learn and helpful when creating your own apps.

Some tools for drawing UML diagrams are: 

* [Violet](https://sourceforge.net/projects/violet/files/violetumleditor/) is a simple, easy-to-use UML editor written in Java. I use version 2.0.1 (not the newest) because it inserts less space.  
* Eclipse plugin - draw UML or generate UML class diagram from Java code.
* Netbeans and IDEA also have UML extensions.
