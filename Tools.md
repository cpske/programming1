> Please Install the JDK and JDK Docs in a path without space.

> The JDK "bin" has many commands you can run from the command line.  To avoid problems with your system PATH, its better to use a *short* path **without spaces**.

> Good: `c:\java\jdk8u144` (Windows), `/opt/java/jdk8u144` (Linux).

## Programming Tools You Will Need

> BlueJ (IDE) for Windows and Mac OSX includes the Java JDK. If you install BlueJ you can skip #1.

1. Java Development Kit (JDK): [JDK 8 Downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/.
2. [JDK Documentation](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/jdk8-doc-downloads-2133158.html). Please install on your computer and **bookmark** the API docs in your browser (demo in class).
    * You can view the [JDK Documentation online](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/) at http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/, but its less efficient.
    * The [Java API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api) is what you need most. Bookmark it!
    * [Download it!](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/jdk8-doc-downloads-2133158.html).  You don't need the JavaFX docs.
        1. Saves time and bandwidth.
        2. Your IDE (Eclipse, BlueJ, Netbeans) will show context sensitive help using the API docs (or JDK source)!
3. An Integrated Development Env (IDE) for writing code. Please try BlueJ, but you can use whatever IDE you prefer.
    * [BlueJ](https://www.bluej.org) - great for learning. You can interactively run code without compiling, view objects, and visualize project structure.
    * [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/downloads) - powerful, but complex.
    * [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/downloads) - easier than Eclipse. Install the "Java SE" version.
    * IntelliJ by JetBrains. Many say its most powerful Java IDE. Somewhat hard to master, I think.
4. [Git command tool](http://git-scm.org/download/) from http://git-scm.org/download/ (not needed at beginning). The "git" command line program is needed to submit some assignments. IDEs have builtin Git support, but command line is sometimes better.

### Recommended

[The Java Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)
the most comprehensive Java tutorial.  The [Really Big Index](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reallybigindex.html) page is the best place to find specific material, so bookmark it.  

We suggest you [download it](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/java-tutorial-downloads-2005894.html) and install on your computer.  You can download the tutorial as HTML or ebooks (ePub).

### Online Coding Sites

* [elab](http://elab.cpe.ku.ac.th) for lab work in this course.
* [codingbat.com](http://codingbat.com/java) for more online coding practice. Has many short problems, with explanation and soluttions.

### UML Diagrams

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is like circuit diagrams for software.
In Programming 2 (OOP) you will use UML diagrams a lot.  If you want to draw your own UML diagrams, some tools are:

* [Violet](https://sourceforge.net/projects/violet/files/violetumleditor/) is a simple, easy-to-use UML editor written in Java. I use version 2.0.1 (not the newest) because it inserts less space.  
* Eclipse plugins - draw UML or generate UML class diagram from Java code.
* Netbeans and IDEA also have UML extensions.
