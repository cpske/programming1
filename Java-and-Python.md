# Java versus Python in Object-Oriented Programming

Which language is better for new SKE students?

# Jobs

[IEEE Spectrum Top Programming Languages for 2017](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/top-programming-languages-2017-focus-on-jobs) ranks Python slightly above C and Java overall (Python 100.0, Java 99.4), but for "Jobs", the ratings are reversed (Java still #1). IEEE Spectrum has an interactive rating tool you can customize the ranking criteria and weights. Data from 10 different sources.

On [Coding Dojo](http://www.codingdojo.com/blog/9-most-in-demand-programming-languages-of-2017/), SQL was most in-demand. Java was #2 (about 68K job postings), Python moved up 2 spots to #3 (40K postings), slightly ahead of Javascript.

A 2016 article on [CodingDojo](http://www.codingdojo.com/blog/9-most-in-demand-programming-languages-of-2017/) used job ads on
Gooroo, Dice, and Tech World for 2015 reported the most ads for Java, Javascript, and C#.  Python and C++ had similarly demand but far behind the top 3.  Demand differs by country, but Java and Javascript always in the top 5.
