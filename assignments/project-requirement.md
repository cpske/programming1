## Project Requirements

## Everyone is a Programmer

* Everyone on team must write a significant amount of code.
* Everyone must commit their own code to Github.  Your credit partially depends on your work.
* Only put **actual author** name in Javadoc comment. **Don't** put whole team in every file.

## App is Runnable by Anyone

* The project should be runnable by anyone with Java.  Not just runnable on your computer.  Don't use absolute paths for any files (other person's computer may not have those paths).
* Must be able to run project without using an IDE. Run from command line or double-clicking on JAR file.

## Use O-O Design

* Use classes and objects.
* One class represents one kind of object or one set of related responsibilities.
    Examples: Ticket, TicketMachine, Store, Item, Movie, Customer, OrderLog, 

## Write Good Code

* Use Java naming and code formatting conventions.
* Write **descriptive class Javadoc comments** in every file.
* Write the best code you can.
* Code review and test everything.

## Has Documentation

Must document:

1. How to install using JAR file you provide.
2. How to compile the source code.
3. How to use application.
4. **Interesting Technology** used in the app, so others can learn.
