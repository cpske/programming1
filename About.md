### Requirement for Individual Work

All assignments *must* be done individually, unless group work is explicitly alowed.  No copying is accepted, even a small part.

It is OK to discuss design and problems you have, but not to share code.  If you need help, please ask the TAs or instructor rather than the other students (who may not give you the correct answer).

**Copying == Fail**  Anyone who submits copied work will receive grade "F" and be reported to Faculty of Engineering for disciplinary action.

### Programming Tools You Will Need

See [Tools](Tools.md).

### Windows Users:

* Please install JDK using a **short path** without a **space**.
* Please use a `workspace` (parent folder) for all your projects that you can easily find -- please **not** use the Desktop.

```
Good path: C:\java\jdk8u20 and C:\java\jdk8\docs
Bad path:  C:\Program Files\Java\JavaSDK 8u20
```

### Textbook and Documentation

Assignments will use material from these sources:

* Horstmann, *Big Java*, 5E or 4E.  The 4th and 5th editions are almost identical. The 4th edition is more concise and some parts are better organized. 5E has better page layout. Both editions cover Java 7, but not the new features in Java 8.
* [The Java Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) (Recommended). The most comprehensive Java tutorial.  The [Really Big Index](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reallybigindex.html) page is the best place to find specific material, so bookmark it.  I suggest you [download it](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/java-tutorial-downloads-2005894.html) and install on your computer. 
* *The Java JDK Documentation*. You are required to install this on your computer and **bookmark** the API index in your web browser. This is a great source of knowledge about the Java platform. Go to [Java SE Downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and scroll down to "Java SE 8 documentation".

### Individual Feedback

The TAs and instructor will review your lab work every week (if possible) and provide feedback and instructions for what you need to fix or improve.  

You must correct all problems or defects in lab work **within one week**.  After that, the TA's evaluation is final.
