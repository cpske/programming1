## Programming 1 

This course is an introduction to programming.  It covers fundamental programming
constructs and the basics of object-oriented programming.   Programming is an
essential skill for the Software and Knowledge Engineering curriculum. Please try

Note: when a file is updated on [github.com/skeoop/skeoop.github.io](https://github.com/skeoop/skeoop.github.io) it may take *many minutes* before the change appears on [skeoop.github.io](https://skeoop.github.io/). 



### Requirement for Individual Work

All assignments *must* be done individually, unless group work is explicitly alowed.  No copying is accepted, even a small part.

It is OK to discuss design and problems you have, but not to share code.  If you need help, please ask the TAs or instructor rather than the other students (who may not give you the correct answer).

**Copying == Fail**  Anyone who submits copied work will receive grade "F" and be reported to Faculty of Engineering for disciplinary action.

### Textbook and Readings

The main sources for this course are:

* Horstmann, *Big Java*, 5E or 4E.  The 4th and 5th editions are almost identical. The 4th edition is more concise and some chapters are better organized. 5E has better page layout. Both editions cover Java 7, but not the new features in Java 8.
* *The Java JDK Documentation*. You are required to install this on your computer and **bookmark** the API index in your web browser. This is a great source of knowledge about the Java platform.
* *The Java Tutorial* from Oracle (Recommended).  I recommend you install this on your computer.  The "Really Big Index" page is the most efficient way to find things in the material, so bookmark it.

### Other Useful Resources

* *Getting Started with Java* by Tony Gaddis.  Covers the same material as *Big Java* but more focus on programming. Several students prefer this book.

### Programming Tools You Will Need

1. **Java 8 JDK** and JRE.  The JDK includes a JRE.  Older versions do not have some features we will use.
2. **Java IDE**  Good ones are: Eclipse, Netbeans, and IntelliJ IDEA.  BlueJ is good for beginners and for trying out code.  I use BlueJ in class. In BlueJ, you can visualize code, interactively run code (without compiling), and inspect objects. 
3. **Git command line tool.**  IDEs include a git tool but you still need the command line git program.  Download from: http://git-scm.org/download/.
4. **UML editor is helpful.** Eclipse, Netbeans, and IDEA have UML extensions that can generate class diagram from Java code. [Violet](https://sourceforge.net/projects/violet/files/violetumleditor/) is a simple, easy-to-use UML editor written in Java. I use version 2.0.1 (not the newest) because it inserts less space.

### Windows Users:

* Please do **not** install IDE, JDK docs, etc. on the desktop! (the actual path will be long have have space)
* Please use a **short path** without a **space** in the name.
```
Good path: C:\java\jdk8u20 and C:\java\jdk8\docs
Bad path:  C:\Program Files\Java\JavaSDK 8u20
```

### Individual Feedback

The TAs and instructor will review your lab work every week (if possible) and provide feedback and instructions for what you need to fix or improve.  

You must correct all problems or defects in lab work **within one week**.  After that, the TA's evaluation is final.
