## Programming 1 

This course is an introduction to programming.  It covers fundamental programming
constructs and the basics of object-oriented programming.   Programming is an
essential skill for the Software and Knowledge Engineering curriculum. Please try
to master the material and earn an 'A' in this course.

### Course Material

The [Source Repository](https://github.com/jbrucker/programming1) contains weekly material for the course as a Git repository, with subdirectories for each week and special topics.

### Requirement for Individual Work

All assignments *must* be done individually, unless group work is explicitly alowed.  No copying is accepted, even a small part.

It is OK to discuss design and problems you have, but not to share code.  If you need help, please ask the TAs or instructor rather than the other students (who may not give you the correct answer).

**Copying == Fail**  Anyone who submits copied work will receive grade "F" and be reported to Faculty of Engineering for disciplinary action.

### Programming Tools You Will Need

1. **Java 8 JDK** and JRE.  The JDK includes a JRE. [Download from Oracle](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
2. **Java IDE**  Good ones are [BlueJ](https://bluej.org), Eclipse, Netbeans, and IntelliJ IDEA.  BlueJ is recommended for trying out Java code and visualization objects. I use BlueJ in class. Please try BlueJ at first.
3. **Git command line tool.**  IDEs include a git tool but you still need the command line git program.  Download from [http://git-scm.org/download/](http://git-scm.org/download/).
4. **UML editor is helpful.** [Violet](https://sourceforge.net/projects/violet/files/violetumleditor/) is a simple, easy-to-use UML editor written in Java. I use version 2.0.1 (not the newest) because it inserts less space.  Eclipse, Netbeans, and IDEA have UML extensions that generate a class diagram from Java code.
5. You also need the Java Documentation, see below.  The *Java Tutorial* is also recommended.

### Windows Users:

* Please do **not** install IDE, JDK docs, etc. on the desktop! (the actual path will be long have have space)
* Please use a **short path** without a **space** in the name.
```
Good path: C:\java\jdk8u20 and C:\java\jdk8\docs
Bad path:  C:\Program Files\Java\JavaSDK 8u20
```

### Textbook and Documentation

Assignments will use material from these sources:

* Horstmann, *Big Java*, 5E or 4E.  The 4th and 5th editions are almost identical. The 4th edition is more concise and some parts are better organized. 5E has better page layout. Both editions cover Java 7, but not the new features in Java 8.
* [The Java Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) (Recommended). The most comprehensive Java tutorial.  The [Really Big Index](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reallybigindex.html) page is the best place to find specific material, so bookmark it.  I suggest you [download it](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/java-tutorial-downloads-2005894.html) and install on your computer. 
* *The Java JDK Documentation*. You are required to install this on your computer and **bookmark** the API index in your web browser. This is a great source of knowledge about the Java platform. Go to [Java SE Downloads](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and scroll down to "Java SE 8 documentation".

### Individual Feedback

The TAs and instructor will review your lab work every week (if possible) and provide feedback and instructions for what you need to fix or improve.  

You must correct all problems or defects in lab work **within one week**.  After that, the TA's evaluation is final.
