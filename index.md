### Recommended Book

<font color="blue"><i>Big Java, 5th Ed.</i></font> by Cay Horstmann.  Book is easy to read, but long.  Horstmann has written many popular Java books, including *Core Java* (favorite of programmers) and *Object-oriented Design & Patterns* (favorite among SKE students).

[Contact me](Contact.md) for how to get *Big Java*.
