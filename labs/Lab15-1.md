## 1. What is a class?  Write a definition.


## 2. Name the 3 key characteristics of objects.

1. 
2. 
3. 

## 3. In this code, make Student be a subclass of Person.

```java
public class Student _________________ { // subclass of Person

    public String toString() {
        return "I am a student";
    }
    public static String what() {
        return "Student";
    }
}
```

```java
public class Person {
    public String toString() {
        return "I am a Person";
    }
    public static String what() {
        return "Person";
    }
}
```

## 4. Use the previous code to answer these questions.

```java
Person p = new Student();
System.out.println("p says "+p.toString());  //1.
System.out.println("p is "+p.what());        //2.
```

4.1 What is printed by `"p says "+p.toString()`?


4.2 Explain the reason for the output from 4.1.


4.3 What is printed by `"p is "+p.what()`?


4.4 Give a reason for the difference between how `p.toString()` behaves (4.1) and `p.what()` behaves (4.3).


## Write an explanation.

5.1 What is the difference between an "attribute" (of an object) and a local variable?


5.2 Suppose Person has a "name" attribute.  What is the "life time" of the attribute?

  (a) From when program starts until the program stops running.
  (b) From when object is created until object is destroyed.
  (c) From when setName() is called until last time getName() is callled.
