## 6. Use the following code:

```java
public class Question6 {
    private double total = 0.0;
    
    public double getTotal(double[] x) {
        for(int k=0; k<x.length; k++) total += x[k];
        return total;
    }
}
```
6.1 What is the error in this code?   Give a reason for your answer.


6.2 How would you fix it?


## 7. Rewrite the `getTotal` method to use a for-each loop.

```java
   public double getTotal(double[] x) {
   

   
   }
```

## 8. Explain why this test for null reference fails.

```java
   public boolean equals(Object arg) {
       if (arg.equals(null)) return false;
       ...
```


## 9. We have a POS application with 2 classes: Coin and Coupon.

Source code is in `src/` directory.

```java
public class Coin {
    private double value;

    public Coin(double value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    public double getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return String.format("%.2f Baht", value);
    }
}
```

```java
/** A Coupon used at KU Faire. */
public class Coupon {
    private double value;
    private String color;

    public Coupon(int value) {
        this.value = value;
        this.color = getCouponColor(value);
    }

    public double getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return String.format("%s Coupon (%.2f)", color, value);
    }

    private static String getCouponColor(int value) {
        // compute and return the color of coupon based on value
    }
}
```

We would like our POS (Point of Sale) application to be able to
compute totals using both Coupons and Coins.  Right now, the code
is really messy:

```
public class KuPOS {

    /** Compute total value of coins received. */
    public static double total(Coin[] coins) {
        double total = 0.0;
        for(Coin c: coins) total += c.getValue();
        return total;
    }

    /** Compute total value of coupons received. */
    public static double total(Coupon[] coupons) {
        double total = 0.0;
        for(Coupon c: coupons) total += c.getValue();
        return total;
    }
}
```

We need separate code for handling Coupon and Coin.  And we can't
compute total for a mix of Coins and Coupons.

How can we use **inheritance** and **polymorphism** so that we don't
need separate methods for totaling `Coupons` and `Coins`?

9.1 Define a **base class** named `Money` that has the behavior you need.

9.2 Make Coin and Coupon be subclasses of Money.  

9.3 Rewrite KuPOS so there is only **one** total method that works for any kind of Money.  Modify the Main class to demonstrate it works.
